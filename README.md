# tp_simplon

This project was carried out in order to pass the preselection stage to integrate the simplon.io school. 

All program logic is in tp_Simplon.java.


The Terminal class, groups together the main input and display methods at the terminal for the predefined types:
- int
- double
- boolean
- char
- String

The Terminal.java source file must be found in the same directory as the tp.

### Details of expected achievement
#### Context of the project
SimplonTheater theaters require you to develop simple software to allow users to
choose cinema seats in a fixed format auditorium: 8 rows with 9 seats in each row.
Users must be able to specify the row in which they want to be placed as well as the number of seats
to book.
Once the row has been chosen and the number of seats specified, you must check whether there is indeed enough space on the row:
- If this is the case, you display the representation of the room to the user and propose a new entry.
- Otherwise, you tell the user that there is no more space in the row or that there is not enough.


The room display is completely free, to put it simply, you use the programming language you want. 
I chose Java for the realization of this project, and drJava as editor. 
I display the result directly in the console, without going through the browser.
